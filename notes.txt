Open input stream
read line from input stream
read one char from that and send it to the tokenizer
if it matches a parenthesis, return it as that token, else try other combos
once we find a token

Algorithm:

(define (parse in)
  (open input file)
  (feed first line to scanner)
  (get a list of tokens)
  (feed list to parser logic) (print errors in parser logic)
  (recirsively call again))
  

If (we reach a space, brace, terminal, etc)
we need to check if there is anything in the token being built

Then we need to try and identify that token

Else add that next char to the token, recursively call again
